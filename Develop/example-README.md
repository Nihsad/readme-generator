# Project 09 - README Generator

  ## Description
  This project is intended to showcase how node.js and its inquirer package can be used to generate a ready-made README file without the user having to format it themselves. This allows the project creator(s) to spend more time on the application itself without having to worry about the monotony of writing yet another README.
