# Project 09 - README Generator

  ## Description
  This project is intended to showcase how node.js and its inquirer package can be used to generate a ready-made README file without the user having to format it themselves. This allows the project creator(s) to spend more time on the application itself without having to worry about the monotony of writing yet another README.

  ## Installation
    As this generator is run in the CLI, it does not have any web-based presence and is not deployed; it runs entirely on the user's own machine. Users will need to download the repository to their own machine. Once there, they can navigate into the project's folder using the command line and run: ```md npm install``` to install all required packages.

  ## Usage
  Once [installation](#installation) has been completed, run: ```md  node index.js``` to start the program. Once each prompt has been completed, hitting 'enter' on the keyboard will move on to the next prompt. Repeat until the program has finished, and the user will have a fully formatted README.md file generated in the project folder!
